# AGL Coding Challenge

This is the code to complete the AGL coding challenge using Vue.js and one JavaScript Azure Function. 

The briefing was this...

*A json web service has been set up at the [url](http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json)*

*You need to write some code to consume the json and output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner*

Navigate <a href="https://aglteststorage.z26.web.core.windows.net" target="_blank">here</a> to see a working version.
